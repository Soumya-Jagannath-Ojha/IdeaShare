# QuickNote

I built a feature-rich notes app that allows users to create, organize, and manage notes efficiently. Users can add tags to their notes, making it easy to categorize and search through titles or tags. This app provides a seamless experience for users to store and access important information quickly and intuitively.

## Features

- Add Notes: Users can create new notes by providing a title, description, and adding relevant tags for easy organization.
- Edit Notes: Users can update their notes, making changes to the title, description, or tags as needed.
- Search Notes: Users can search for specific notes by either the title or tags, ensuring quick access to the information they need.
- Tag Management: Tags allow for better organization and filtering of notes, making it easier to categorize and locate them efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- React: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for creating, editing, deleting, and searching notes efficiently.
- TypeScript: Ensures strong typing, improves code quality, and enhances developer productivity with autocomplete and error-checking.
- LocalStorage: Persists user data locally, allowing notes to be saved and retrieved even after page reloads or browser sessions, without needing a backend.
